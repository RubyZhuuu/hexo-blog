title: My Own First Article

This is [RubyZhuu's](https://github.com/RubyZhuuu) first Article.

I use [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/) to build my blog. You can get into it quick if you know something about nodeJs.

After you install nodeJS, you just need 5 steps to init a blog:

``` bash
$ npm install hexo-cli -g
$ hexo init blog //blog is the folder, you can take place with another
$ cd blog
$ npm install
$ hexo server
```
